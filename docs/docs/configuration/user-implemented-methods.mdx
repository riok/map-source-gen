# User implemented mapping methods

If Mapperly cannot generate a mapping, one can implement it manually simply by providing a method body in the mapper declaration:

```csharp
[Mapper]
public partial class CarMapper
{
    public partial CarDto CarToCarDto(Car car);

    private int TimeSpanToHours(TimeSpan t) => t.Hours;
}
```

Whenever Mapperly needs a mapping from `TimeSpan` to `int` inside the `CarMapper` implementation, it will use the provided implementation.

## Use external mappings

Mapperly can also consider mappings implemented in other classes.
In order for Mapperly to find the mappings, they must be made known with `UseMapper` / `UseStaticMapper`.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="static" label="Static">

For static mappings, `UseStaticMapper` can be used:

```csharp
[Mapper]
// highlight-start
[UseStaticMapper(typeof(BananaMapper))]
// highlight-end
public static partial class BoxMapper
{
  public static partial BananaBox MapBananaBox(BananaBoxDto dto);
}

public static class BananaMapper
{
  public static Banana MapBanana(BananaDto dto)
    => new Banana(dto.Weigth);
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="instance" label="Instance">

To use the mappings of an object instance `UseMapper` can be used:

```csharp
[Mapper]
public static partial class BoxMapper
{
    // highlight-start
    [UseMapper]
    private readonly BananaMapper _bananaMapper = new();
    // highlight-end

    public static partial BananaBox MapBananaBox(BananaBoxDto dto);
}

public static class BananaMapper
{
    public static Banana MapBanana(BananaDto dto)
        => new Banana(dto.Weigth);
}
```

:::info
The initialization of fields and properties annotated with `UseMapper` needs to be done by the user.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Whenever Mapperly needs a mapping from `BananaBox` to `BananaBoxDto` inside the `BoxMapper` implementation,
it will use the provided implementation by the `BananaMapper`.

Used mappers themselves can be Mapperly backed classes.
