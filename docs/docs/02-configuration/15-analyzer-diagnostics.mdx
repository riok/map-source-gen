# Analyzer diagnostics

Mapperly emits several diagnostics:

<AnalyzerRules></AnalyzerRules>

:::info
Mapperly only emits updated source code on build.
You won't see the updated mapper code or mapper diagnostics until you perform a build.

This is done for performance reasons,
otherwise the IDE could become laggy.
Improvements are tracked in [#72](https://github.com/riok/mapperly/issues/72).

## Editorconfig

The severity of these diagnostics can be customized via an `.editorconfig` file:

```editorconfig title=".editorconfig"
[*.cs]
dotnet_diagnostic.{RuleID}.severity = error
dotnet_diagnostic.RMG020.severity = error
```
