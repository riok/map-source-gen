## Migration guide from v3.6.0

- Adjust `.editorconfig` as needed, see [removed and replaced diagnostics](#removed-and-replaced-diagnostics)
- If the `ExplicitCast` conversion is disabled, disable the new `EnumUnderlyingType` conversion too

## Removed and replaced diagnostics

The following diagnostics are removed or replaced. You may need to update the `.editorconfig` files.

- `RMG017: An init only member can have one configuration at max` and `RMG027: A constructor parameter can have one configuration at max` merged into the new `RMG074: Multiple mappings are configured for the same target member`
- `RMG026: Cannot map from indexed member` is removed, starting with 4.0 indexed members are ignored
- `RMG028: Constructor parameter cannot handle target paths` is removed as this is now supported.

## Enum underlying type conversion

A new `EnumUnderlyingType` conversion is added.
Whenever Mapperly tries to map from/to an enum and does not succeed,
Mapperly tries to map from/to the underlying type of the enum and explicitly cast the resulting value to the enum type.
Until v3.6.0 Mapperly used the `ExplicitCast` to enable/disable this conversion.
Starting with v4.0 Mapperly introduces a new `EnumUnderlyingType` conversion to enable/disable this conversion.
